    "question": "give me two examples of how the MDTF supported private sector job creation in 2020",
    "answer": "Two examples of how the MDTF supported private sector job creation in 2020 are:\n\n1. In Zambia, the Let's Work Program analyzed poultry and aquaculture value chains and highlighted the potential to expand small-scale farmer income in the sector. The program concluded that policies to unlock job growth potential will need to enable more farmers to participate in commercial markets by increasing quantities and improving quality.\n\n2. In Mozambique, the Let's Work program studied the cassava, cashew, and plantation forestry value chains to understand the potential for inclusive private sector-led job creation by integrating farmers into agribusiness. The team developed a policy note highlighting challenges that need to be overcome to accelerate structural transformation in Mozambique.\n\nAdditionally, outside of the Let's Work initiative, IFC’s Tackling Childcare grant built evidence on the business case for gender-smart childcare services in the workplace and provided ideas on how the private sector can adopt such policies.",
